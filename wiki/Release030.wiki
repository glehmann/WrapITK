WrapITK release page for version 0.3.0.

= Introduction =

For the first time since its integration in ITK, WrapITK is releasing a new version. This is the result of hard work to enhance the whole wrapping process, the class coverage, the target languages integration and the user experience.

= Wrapping process enhancements =

  * native swig;
  * full separation of types declaration and code generation;
  * code generation based on callback macros.

= Class coverage =

= Target languages changes =

== Python ==

=== No SmartPointers anymore ===

SmartPointers are not wrapped anymore in python. There are several consequences:
  * Binary are about 50% smaller than before;
  * Load time is greatly decreased;
  * GetPointer() is no more needed, to pass a smart pointed object to a function which require a super class of the object. GetPointer() is still available for backward compatibility but display a warning when used. It should disappear in one of the next release;

=== No optional patch -- the features are available by default ===

=== No unusable std::basic_string anymore ===

=== Better repr() for simple types ===

=== Casting ===

=== `[]` is a better GetOutput() ===

=== () is a better UpdateLargestPossibleRegion() ===

=== Doc integration ===


== Java ==

=== No SmartPointers anymore ===


== Tcl ==

== New languages ==

= Supported platforms =

WrapITK is tested on the following platforms:

  * Mac OS X 10.5 Intel
  * GNU/Linux
  * OpenSolaris
  * Microsoft Windows

It may also work on other platforms, but has not been tested yet.

= Known issues =

  * Because of swig bug #2583160, python modules can't be loaded with python 2.6 when built with swig 1.3.37 or 1.3.38;
  * Because of swig bug #2552048, python generated doc doesn't contain method signature when built with swig 1.3.37;
  * BinaryDilateImageFilter has no SetKernel() method in Tcl. No know reason yet. Other classes may be affected.
